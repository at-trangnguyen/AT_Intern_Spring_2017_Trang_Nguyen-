1. Git - GitHub - Repositoty
- Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files.
- GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
-Repository, or repo, is a folder that you’ve told Git to help you track file changes in. You can have any number of repos on your computer, each stored in their own folder. Each Git repo on your system is independent, so changes saved in one Git repo don’t affect the contents of another.
A Git repo contains every version of every file saved in the repo. Git saves these files very efficiently, so having a large number of versions doesn’t mean that it uses a lot of disk space
2. Branch - Pull request
-New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project. The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again.
Create branch :$ git checkout -b branch_name
Delete branch :$ git branch -D brand_name
- Pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their Github account. This lets everybody involved know that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.
